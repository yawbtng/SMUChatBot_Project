# Welcome to PerunaBot! ðŸš€

Hi there, Student! ðŸ‘‹ We're excited to have you on board and help us test PerunaBot! 

PerunaBot is a chatbot designed just for resources at SMU. Right now, it access to the course catalog and financial info. 

This is a very basic prototype so it may not be able to answer very specific questions but ask any questions you have.

### We just have 2 requests for you:

- If you feel that PerunaBot gave a good or bad response, hit the thumbs up or thumbs down button **under the response** and type feedback on why you thought it was good or bad. This could be based on accuracy, relevancy, specificity, etc.

- **Please give us more specific feedback using the google form below!**
